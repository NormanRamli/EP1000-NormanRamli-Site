explain mapping of red and blue

Hello everyone, my name is Norman and today Ill be showing you my DFAB project called the skeleton lamp

When thinking of the final project,I knew I wanted to make some sort of lamp but I wanted it to be more unique. I then came across these pictures which I thought were super cool and decided to have my own go at it

So heres the modelling process, my lamp consists of 5 main parts, The base, The fins, the 3 circular sections that hold the fins together, a rod to coil the leds as  well as a knob that is attached to a potentiometer

One thing I found really useful designing the lamp was the circular pattern under the create menu. This allowed me to duplicate the fins easily without having to manually position them.

Now heres a montage of the 3d printing and the laser cutting

Moving on to the electronics,
For the output device, I used a 24 led neopixel strip.
For the input devices I used 2 potentiometers, one to change the hue and one to change the brightness

To change the brightness,  I mapped the 1024 values that the arduino can read from the potentiometer to the 255 levels of brightness that can be set to the neopixel

As for the hue I did something similar. Instead of the 255 levels be brightness, I set it to red and blue individually. I stored the range of 0-255 into one variable named__ for red
and 255-0 in another variable for blue

This is so that when the potentiometer is turned, it will go from one end of the red spectrum to the other end of the blue spectrum 

With that heres the final product
